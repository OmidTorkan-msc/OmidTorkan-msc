âœ…3.Data Augmentation:
Injects synthetic sentences with predefined sentiment polarity (positive or negative) into training datasets to test sentiment shifts.
Simulates real-world sentiment variations to enhance model robustness.

âœ…4.Visualization:
Plots trends in sentiment polarity across datasets before and after data augmentation.
Provides clear insights into how sentiment shifts impact overall contract tone.
