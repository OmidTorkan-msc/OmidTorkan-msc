# Hello, I'm Omid Torkan ðŸ‘‹

## About

Hello! I'm Omid Torkan, a passionate software developer and data scientist with a strong academic background and hands-on experience in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Milan, where I completed several projects focusing on advanced AI techniques and their applications.

Throughout my academic journey and professional experience, I have developed a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python and SQL, and I'm proficient in using various data analysis and machine learning libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. I have also worked extensively with deep learning architectures, particularly LSTM networks and bidirectional LSTMs, for NLP tasks.

My portfolio showcases a range of projects, from sentiment analysis and data augmentation to custom machine learning model development. I am particularly interested in the practical applications of AI in business information systems and information retrieval, which were key focus areas in my coursework and thesis.

In addition to my technical skills, I am proficient in data visualization with Matplotlib and have experience in data pipeline automation and web scraping. My projects reflect a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical implementation, aiming to solve real-world problems with innovative solutions.

I am always eager to learn new technologies and take on challenging projects that push the boundaries of what is possible with AI and data science. Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate or discuss interesting ideas!
